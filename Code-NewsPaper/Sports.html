<button class="accordion1"><strong><em>Will RCB find the spark that their season needs?</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
	<p><img src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fcricket%2Fcricinfo%2F1143962_1296x729.jpg&w=920&h=518&scale=crop&cquality=80&location=origin" width="85%"></p><br>
  <p>The slow and low tracks from 2017 have made way for the high-scoring matches that Bengaluru is so very familiar with. Teams have raced along at 9.52 per over and while that would seem perfect for the batting-heavy Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have lost games despite posting scores of 198 and 205. Bowling at the death has always been an issue for the IPL's perennial bridesmaids, but this season they have outdone even themselves.</p><p>

RCB have recently preferred bowling out both Umesh Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal before the 16th over. As a result, the pressure of closing an innings out has fallen on Chris Woakes and Corey Anderson, who are relatively inexperienced with respect to Indian conditions, and Kulwant Khejroliya and Mohammed Siraj, who are inexperienced, period.</p>

<p>Now this plan certainly has some merits - bumping up the required rate in a chase, for example - but it also has one big loophole. Experienced batsmen have been able to see off Umesh and Chahal out and go hard against the other three. Chahal, speaking to the media on the eve of RCB's game against Kolkata Knight Riders, admitted this as well.</p>

<p>"They [CSK] needed a hundred [99] off the last seven overs when I bowled in the 14th over," he said. "We planned for a wicket and if we got a wicket, they only had Bravo left. But they planned that they wouldn't hit me, only wanted singles against me and choosing to attack the other bowlers. Sometimes, one guy is hitting but second guy is defending. But last match both were attacking, and they chose their bowler."</p>

<p>Umesh can't be used in the final stages: he conceded 27 in the final over against Rajasthan Royals, 28 in two overs against Mumbai Indians and 30 in two against Kolkata Knight Riders. Anderson lost it against the Super Kings. So perhaps RCB should look more closely at Tim Southee. He brings both pace and accuracy and is a proven performer in the death for New Zealand.</p>

<p>Of course, there is no such thing as a quick fix in cricket. Just better planning. So what can the Royal Challengers do to get the better of KKR's big-hitting overseas batsmen and quality international spin bowlers? Pace onto the bat brings Chris Lynn and Andre Russell into play, but a slow, turning surface brings in the 12 overs from Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav and Piyush Chawla.</p>

<p>Chahal, however, believes that quality spin doesn't really help at the Chinnaswamy stadium. "I am enjoying bowling, ball is spinning so obviously a spinner will enjoy [conditions]," he said. "KKR have three quality spinners, and even our spinners are good, so [a good score] depends on how the pitch is tomorrow. Even last game it was spinning a lot, but we still scored 200, so depends how you're batting. [Washington] Sundar is bowling well too, and even he has gotten hit."</p>

<button class="accordion1"><strong><em>Rohit stops Mumbai's freefall with match-winning fifty!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br><strong><em>Mumbai Indians 170 for 2 (Rohit 56*, Lewis 47) beat Chennai Super Kings 169 for 5 (Raina 75*, Rayudu 46, McClenaghan 2-26) by eight wickets.</em></strong></p>
  <br><img src="http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fcricket%2Fcricinfo%2F1144716_900x506.jpg&w=570">
  <p><br>Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma promoted himself to No. 3 to guide his team to an eight-wicket win against Chennai Super Kings, after walking in with a required rate at ten per over on a two-paced pitch. Rohit's well-paced, and unbeaten, half-century first took the pressure off a struggling Evin Lewis and then sealed a chase of 170 in comfortable fashion.</p>

<p>Earlier in the game, Mumbai had fought back after the tournament-leader for runs, Ambati Rayudu, and Suresh Raina, had set Super Kings up for a massive total at 91 for 1 in ten overs. The innings then spiralled downwards and even a late flourish from Raina, who was unbeaten on 75, couldn't get them enough on the evening.</p>

<p><strong>Mumbai's changes</strong></p>

<p>Mumbai had persisted with more or less the same team for each of their six games before Saturday. When they did decide to make changes, it didn't seem like too much would change. There was a good chance that the replacements - JP Duminy for Kieron Pollard and Ben Cutting for Mustafizur Rahman - wouldn't have prominent roles to play if a successful top order remained true to form.</p>

<p>This was doubly true for Cutting, who, despite replacing a specialist bowler, bowled only one over. Super Kings batsmen Rayudu and Raina took him for 14 and brought up a fifty-run stand for the second wicket.</p>

<p><strong>Rohit shows up</strong></p>

<p>Lewis was dismissed for a duck by Deepak Chahar when these teams last played, but the head-to-head tonight lasted only one ball with the seamer walking off the field in the fifth over. At the post-match press conference, CSK coach Stephen Fleming confirmed that Chahar had suffered a hamstring injury and would be out for at least two weeks.</p>

<p>Lewis' struggle continued even as partner Suryakumar Yadav put his rich form to good use. When their lopsided opening stand of 69 ended through a brilliant take from Ravindra Jadeja at deep midwicket, Lewis was 21 off 26. Although a couple of swats against Imran Tahir got his scoring rate up, the opener's stay was a troubled one.</p>

<p>That it didn't hurt Mumbai was down to Rohit's performance. His one-handed six at long-off, off Watson's first ball in the 14th over, was the beginning of the phase where the required rate fell below nine. A couple of balls later, he showed that he would control the rest of the chase, getting down to scoop a full ball over fine leg for another six.</p>

<p>All of his boundaries from that point onwards showed a tremendous awareness of the field. A pull over square leg off Bravo, a lofted drive against Watson in the 18th set up for the big 19th over, with Mumbai needing 22 off 12.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Dhoni chose to change Bravo, whose 17th had gone for five, and handed the ball to Shardul Thakur. The bowler nailed only one yorker, the one that got Rohit back on strike. His attempted yorkers then flew over point, two went over square leg and the change-up length ball was expertly dabbed between short third man and point.</p>

<p>With that 17-run over, during which he brought up his fifty, Rohit made sure that Mumbai wins.</p>

<button class="accordion1"><strong><em>
What makes Sunrisers Hyderabad's bowling attack so good?</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Speaking to ESPNcricinfo after Pakistan's Champions Trophy victory last year, bowling coach Azhar Mahmood uttered a memorable line: "batsmen win you games, bowlers win you tournaments."</p>

<p>It's a theory a number of coaches buy into, and one the numbers support as well.</p>

<p>Perth Scorchers' strategy of investing heavily in their bowling combination, under coach Justin Langer, has led them to three Big Bash League titles and two runner-up finishes. All this in only seven years of the tournament. Year on year, Scorchers have rarely outhit their oppositions, but have more often than not outbowled them.</p>

<p>Another T20 team in bright orange, Sunrisers Hyderabad, follow the same principles. They won the 2016 IPL with the worst middle order in the tournament but easily the best bowling attack, and they have stuck to that template since.</p>
<p><br><img src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fcricket%2Fcricinfo%2F1144533_1296x729.jpg&w=920&h=518&scale=crop&cquality=80&location=origin" width="85%"></p>

<p><br>Take this year's player auction, where their coach Tom Moody had the opportunity to build a team from scratch. Retaining Bhuvneshwar Kumar, their spearhead for the past two seasons, was a no-brainer, as was buying back Rashid Khan, the world's best T20 bowler. But they kept stockpiling even more bowling options. They bulked up their overseas quota with the tall and pacy Billy Stanlake and allrounders Chris Jordan, Carlos Brathwaite, Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Nabi.</p>

<p>And they kept picking up Indian fast bowlers, one after another, while other teams passed up the opportunity. Sunrisers bid aggressively for Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma, T Natarajan and Khaleel Ahmed. It was clear they were backing their bowlers to win them games this season, and boy, have they delivered.</p>

<p>In the season's first three games, Sunrisers restricted their oppositions to totals of under 150 and chased them all down. That was expected to be their blueprint, and Rashid, Bhuvneshwar, Stanlake and Shakib all played their part in the wins. Two losses followed in batting-friendly conditions, and then came the acid test - injuries to Bhuvneshwar and Stanlake.</p>

<p>The blow would have crippled any other team. Imagine Mumbai Indians losing Jasprit Bumrah and Mustafizur Rahman. But this was exactly what Sunrisers had prepared for. In came Sandeep, with the ability to swing the ball both ways like Bhuvneshwar, and Thampi, not as tall as Stanlake but almost as quick, with a pinpoint yorker to boot.</p>

<p>With Kaul, Rashid and Shakib doing their bit, Sunrisers went on to defend scores of 118 and 132 against two of the tournnament's most fearsome batting line-ups, bowling Mumbai out for 87 and Kings XI Punjab for 119</p>.

<p>Do these feats make this year's Sunrisers the best T20 bowling team, ever? Not yet. But their patterns are similar to the most successful T20 bowling sides ever assembled. This season, Sunrisers have topped the league in three of the four basic parameters that measure the efficiency of a bowling outfit - wickets taken, economy rate and average - and are second behind Mumbai Indians on strike rate.</p>

<button class="accordions"><strong><em>Juventus pulling off Stunning Comeback to boost title hopes!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Serie A leaders Juventus scored twice in the last three minutes to secure a dramatic win over 10-man Inter Milan and maintain control of the title race.
With just one minute remaining, the destination of the title looked to be in Napoli's hands, but Gonzalo Higuain headed home the winner for Juve.
He struck moments after Juan Cuadrado had levelled, as Inter overturned Douglas Costa's opener through Mauro Icardi and an Andrea Barzagli own go.</p>

<p>Juve are now four points clear.</p>

<p>Napoli - who have four games to play - can reduce the deficit to one if they win at Fiorentina on Sunday. But the manner of this Juve win could stun their challengers as the defending champions appeared to have thrown away the lead despite having a one-man advantage for over 75 minutes.</p>

<p>"I think football was the winner, as we saw two teams battle it out to the end," said Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri afterwards.</p>
<p><br><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/B084/production/_101088154_higuain.jpg"></p>

<p>As the clock ran down, Juventus' six-year grip on Serie A seemed to be weakening with Napoli closing in on a first title since 1990.

Such was the joy prompted by Higuain's goal, Allegri was sent to the stands for trying to calm his players' wild celebrations after the winner.

He had called for his side to be more physical and streetwise after a last-minute defeat by Napoli last week but they took their foot off the gas after Matias Vecino was dismissed by the video assistant referee (VAR) for a tackle on Mario Mandzukic.</p>

<p>Defeat comes at a great cost to Inter, who are a point outside the top four, with fourth-placed Lazio holding a game in hand.

Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic looked to offer resistance as Juve pressed late on - saving brilliantly from a Paulo Dybala free-kick - but he could do nothing as Cuadrado drove the equaliser from a narrow angle.</p>

<p>Both Inter and Napoli may feel aggrieved the already booked Miralem Pjanic was not dismissed for a heavy challenge in the second-half but he survived, as did Juve, just, thanks to Higuain's dramatic close-range finish.

Higuain had gone 716 minutes without a goal - his longest drought in Italian football - but could not have picked a better time to end it.</p>

</div>

<button class="accordions"><strong><em>Man City reaches 100 league premier goals to increase West Ham troubles!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><strong>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola hailed the "incredible" numbers produced by his side as they reached 100 Premier League goals for the season with a 4-1 win at struggling West Ham.</strong></p>
<p><br><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/9D2F/production/_101093204_gettyimages-952685190.jpg"></p>
<p>The champions' emphatic victory at London Stadium left the Hammers in a precarious position above the relegation zone.

"The numbers are a consequence of what we have done," Guardiola said.</p>

<p>"We are so happy to be getting close to history. We will try to surpass the number of goals and points.

"We wanted to win today so that we can get the record of 96 points at home when we get the trophy in front of our people next week."</p>

<p>City - who are now on 93 points - took the lead when Leroy Sane's shot deflected off the head of Patrice Evra and wrong-footed Hammers goalkeeper Adrian.

A series of West Ham defensive mishaps culminated in a Pablo Zabaleta own goal which gave City a two-goal advantage and saw them reach the landmark century.</p>

<p>Aaron Cresswell gave the Hammers a foothold in the game shortly before the break when he curled home a free-kick inside Ederson's near post.

However, inspired by a brilliant performance from Raheem Sterling, City reasserted their control of the contest early in the second half.</p>

<p>Having earlier teed up Sane, Sterling claimed a hat-trick of assists after the break when he set up Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho to finish clinically from inside the box.

West Ham are three points clear of 18th-placed Southampton, who occupy the final relegation place.</p>

<button class="accordions"><strong><em>Incoming Liverpool midfielder Keita sent off for the fourth time this season!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><strong>RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita, who is joining Liverpool in July, was sent off for the fourth time this season as his team lost at struggling Mainz.He was shown a yellow, then a red card in quick succession for fouling Mainz scorers Alexandru Maxim and Bote Baku.</strong></p>

<p><br><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/0347/production/_101093800_keita_epa.jpg"></p>
<p>Keita was sent off twice for Leipzig and once for Guinea between 16 September and 25 October.

He will be suspended for Saturday's match against Wolfsburg - Leipzig's final home game before his exit.</p>

<p><strong>Naby Keita:</strong> From the streets of Guinea to a £48m Liverpool move
Listen: 'Liverpool have been very smart to agree Keita deal'
Pablo de Blasis scored the other goal for Mainz, who are 14th but can still be relegated.</p>

<p>Last August, Liverpool confirmed a deal to sign Keita.

The Reds agreed to pay the £48m release clause, plus a premium, to allow the 22-year-old to move this summer. However, Leipzig's recent form is likely to save Liverpool money.</p>

<p>They would have had to pay a total of £59m had Leipzig reached the Champions League - but they are now five points off the top four with two games left. If they qualify for the Europa League - which they are on course to do - the Reds will pay £52.75m.

Keita's first red card of the season came in Leipzig's 2-2 home draw with Borussia Monchengladbach in September.</p>

<p>He was dismissed after scoring for Guinea in a 4-1 World Cup qualifying defeat by Tunisia on 7 October.

Keita also got a red card in a German Cup home tie with Bayern Munich on 25 October.</p>

<div class="panel">

  <p><strong><em>Spaniard takes his record to 401-35 on clay. He has won a record 55 titles on the dirt.</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>Rafael Nadal continued his clay-court dominance by collecting a record-extending 11th title in Barcelona on Sunday.
His 6-2 6-1 victory over Greek teenager Stefanos Tsitsipas enabled the Spaniard to hold onto his world No 1 ranking as he chalked up his 19th successive win on clay and he has now won 46 consecutive sets on the red dirt, extending his own record.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old won his 11th Monte Carlo Masters last weekend while Sunday's victory also reinforced his status as the overwhelming favourite to lift the French Open for the 11th time in June.</p>

<p>His win on Sunday was greeted by ticker-tape and a video review of all his titles on the centre court in Barcelona which now bears his name.</p>
<p><br><img src="http://e0.365dm.com/18/04/16-9/20/skysports-rafael-nadal-tennis_4296505.jpg?20180429172959"></p>

<p><br>"It's really emotional to see that video. I never dreamed of having a career like this," said the 16-time Grand Slam title winner. "Last year, they made a video of my 10 titles here. Now they have had to make another video for 11 - it makes me feel like I am ageing.

<button class="accordion"><strong><em>Daniel Jacobs calls out Jermall Charlo after beating Sulecki!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As banged up as the 31-year-old Jacobs was from the fight, it didn’t look like he had position to call out the unbeaten Charlo. If anything, Jacobs should have been talking about giving Sulecki a rematch, as the fight was a lot closer than the scores – 116-111, 117-110 and 115-112 – turned in by the three judges last night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

  <p><br><img src="http://www.boxingnews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jacobs511-768x316.jpg"></p>

<p>Jacobs looked very tired from the 6th round, falling off balance after throwing shots. A good fighter like Charlo would have countered Jacobs immediately if he was off balance as often as he was last night against Sulecki.</p>

<p>Being out of position against Charlo would have been bad for Jacobs. Sulecki didn’t have the power to hurt Jacobs when he was catching him with shots when he was off balance. Jacobs was still beaten up though in the fight, as you could tell by listening to his post-fight interview. Jacobs sounded almost drunk when he was talking. That was caused by the accumulation of heavy shots that Sulecki had hit Jacobs with during the fight.</p>

<p>I’d be very surprised if Jacobs’s promoter Eddie Hearn lets him anywhere near Charlo. If Jacobs wants the Charlo fight, he’s probably going to have to seriously push Hearn to give him permission to take it, because I doubt the British promoter will ever agree to that fight. Hearn is the type of promoter who matches his fighters against guys where they have all the advantages – speed, power, size and fighting in their hometowns.</p>

<p>The Jacobs-Sulecki fight was televised on HBO Boxing, and at times, it seemed as if the commentators were cheer-leading for Jacobs, who has a contract with the network. Jacobs looked like the house fighter with the HBO talking heads pouring compliments over his head by the bucketful as he struggled BADLY against the B-side guy Sulecki. It was a different fight than the ones that the HBO commentators were describing to the fans, as Sulecki was giving Jacobs all he could handle.</p>

<button class="accordion"><strong><em>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: CROSBY STILL THE BEST OF THE BEST WHEN IT MATTERS THE MOST!</em></strong></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><strong>Sidney Crosby remains at the top of his game as he skates into his back half of his career, and he doesn’t want to hand off the crown – or the Stanley Cup – anytime soon.</strong></p>


<p>You obviously can’t see it under his helmet and it’s not detectable on television, but if you look closely enough, the flecks of white are there on the side of Sidney Crosby’s head. This keeps up and he’s bound at some point soon to get two minutes for lookin’ so good. With Alex Ovechkin sporting the full-on salt-and-pepper look, it dawns on you that these guys have fewer years left in the NHL than they’ve played. Crosby is not a kid, or even The Kid anymore. In fact, his off-again, on-again line with Jake Guentzel on the left and Conor Sheary on the right goes by the moniker of ‘Sid and the Kids.’ They grow up so fast.</p>

<p><br><img src="http://storage-cube.quebecormedia.com/v1/dynamic_resize?quality=75&size=1500x1500&src=http%3A%2F%2Fstorage-cube.quebecormedia.com%2Fv1%2Fthn_prod%2Fthe_hockey_news%2F7cac3a092bacf8b89c339a0a057a366136cc2f89%2FSidney-Crosby-staring-ahead.jpg" width="85%"></p>

<p>Crosby hit one of those crossroads birthdays this past summer, even if they say 30 is the new 20. Those people haven’t played in the NHL or examined the analytics that suggest a player’s peak is at 29, or even before that, and it’s all downhill from there. They haven’t had to deal with cohorts of “generational players” who keep coming into the NHL more frequently at younger and younger ages and do things that are more and more sublime. So what do you get the guy who has everything and has done everything? “I mean, I’m not a big birthday party kind of guy,” Crosby said.</p>

<p>Too bad. You’re going to parade through your hometown with the Stanley Cup in the back of a truck, just days after doing the same thing in the little town where you played junior hockey. You’re going to take it to a local children and veterans’ hospital and to a hockey camp before retiring to a party with your closest family and friends, complete with a salted caramel buttercream cake that replicates in minute detail the dryer you used to shoot pucks in when you were a kid. You will bring your friends and your community together because you’ve come to realize that your triumphs are theirs, too. You’ll watch your buddies get a little goofy, while you sit back quietly and take it all in. “I’ve been to his party the last two years and if he wins it again this year, I don’t think I could survive another one,” said Colby Armstrong, Crosby’s former teammate with the Pittsburgh Penguins and one of his closest friends. “I kind of went a little hard. He’s pretty reserved, but he has some buddies who go hard for him. He kind of just hangs around and laughs and giggles, but he doesn’t really get ’er going too hard.”</p>
