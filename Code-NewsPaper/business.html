	<h1 id="one" >Fresh Bid for Essar Steel may see Jindal Vs Mittal Vs Agarwal
	</h1>
	<img src="onel.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p id="sp"><p>The lenders of Essar Steel have decided to meet again on Friday to take a call on inviting fresh round of bids. The war front is becoming clearer and a tough battle is expected between three business houses - JSW, ArcelorMittal and Vedanta.</p>

<p>According to the sources in the banking industry, the new round of bid will see larger bids since it will be the last chance to win the battle. In addition, they expect that the bids may go up the size of over Rs 35,000 crore, when Essar's loans stands at around Rs 45,000 crore.  At the same time, they are still confused on the fate of the second round of bid, which was termed invalid by the NCLT about a week back. After NCLT's order, the lenders opened the first round of bids and in which ArcelorMittal is believed to have emerged as the largest bidder with an offer of over Rs 30,000 crore.</p>

<p>Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW group, had earlier evinced his interest in participating in the bid and JSW Steel had written to the lenders about their wish to submit the bid. If it's going for a new round, Jindal is expected to get the chance to submit his proposal.</p>

<p>After Rewant Ruia, son of Essar group co-founder Ravi Ruia, exited from the Numetal Consortium, which bid in the first round, JSW Steel joined the consortium which is led by Russian financing company VTB. But still it's not clear whether Jindal would prefer the consortium or form another one with his trusted partners like Aion and JFE Steel Corporation, say sources.</p>

<p>However, the unanswered question in the whole process is the eligibility of potential bidders. ArcelorMittal has started the process for disassociating itself from other bankrupt companies like Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. But some are saying the sale of stakes won't absolve them of responsibility of the stakeholder.</p>

<p>JSW Steel is the only bidder for Monnet Ispat and the insolvency process is about to be completed.</p>

<p>Another likely bidder, Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources had submitted its bid in the second round, which hasn't yet opened. Vedanta has already bagged ElectroSteel Steels. Since the bid price of Essar is likely to go up in the fresh round, can Jindal and Agarwal take the financial load to counter the bid of global steel giant ArcelorMittal is the question, industry experts say.</p>

<p>If LN Mittal's firm qualifies for the bid, they clearly have a financial edge.</p>

	<h1 id="two">Who is Mohammad Farooq? The 'hawala operator' arrested in Rs 2,253 crore money laundering scam
	</h1>
	<img src="twol.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p id="sp">
		<p>The Indian banking sector has been caught sleeping on the job, again. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested one of Mumbai's biggest hawala operators on Tuesday in a Rs 2,253 crore fake import remittances case. According to the Times of India, Mohammad Farooq alias Farooq Shaikh used 13 companies, including Stelkon Infratel Pvt Ltd, to remit this huge sum to overseas destinations by using forged import documents. This case just pertains to the Rs 2,253 crore remitted in 2015-16. The ED estimates that the fraud could cross Rs 10,000 crore.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Mohammad Farooq?</strong><br>

The 39-year-old hawala operator, believed to be associated with underworld elements, had set up over 160 dummy companies at fictitious addresses with dummy directors, including an auto driver. For instance, one flat in Katta Bazaar was the address of four of his companies, all of which were all floated using the Importer Exporter Code.<br>

According to the daily, he offered 'services' like helping to undervalue imports to escape duty, facilitating cash transfers within India and abroad illegally for a fee, and arranging cash for corporate houses, i.e. accepting cheques and returning cash to them. This entire empire was run from a one-room office in Mumbai's Zaveri Bazaar.<br>

Farooq has long been under the scanner of multiple authorities. The Navi Mumbai police was reportedly looking for him for smuggling 20,000 pieces of prohibited 13-inch swords and an 8-inch automatic knife. And JNPT Customs has cases against him for smuggling copper in scrap metals.</p>

<p><strong>His modus operandi</strong><br>

Importers in the country have been known to evade customs duty or at least deliberately reduce the liability by undervaluing their goods. But in such cases the actual value has to be paid to the supplier. According to the report, Farooq took care of this through illegal channels for a 2 per cent commission.<br>

He used his accounts with co-operative banks to deposit the cash collected from his 'clients'. After routing the money through several layers of transactions using his dummy companies, he would bring the money into his accounts, mainly in nationalized banks. Farooq was reportedly operating over 130 bank accounts in various banks across Mumbai. The final step was to make the remittances after submitting forged documents - a fake bill of entry would be submitted to the bank to clear outward payment to the exporter through RTGS or NEFT. <br>

Damningly, Stelkon and the other 12 dummy companies managed to remit over Rs 2,200 crore amount against actual bills of entry amounting to just Rs 24.64 crore.</p>

<p><strong>What tipped off the authorities?</strong><br>

Citing ED officials, the daily claimed that Farooq was on the radar of various probe agencies since 2014. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had investigated the case of inflated outward remittances and submitted a report to the ED in 2016 for action under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Last May, the CBI also registered a case as it suspected the role of bank officials in the scam. Subsequently, ED entered the fray against the same set of the accused.<br>


Though the scam was busted last May by the CBI - it had been dubbed the "foreign exchange scandal" - Farooq's involvement was discovered more recently. He was arrested because the ED believes he was using three mobile numbers thrown up while scrutinising 149 bank accounts for this case. Actually, after being intercepted at Mumbai International Airport by the Bureau of Immigration, he was taken for an interrogation. But due to his non-cooperative attitude during the recording of his statement, the agency decided to arrest him.<br>

He has reportedly refused to cooperate with the authorities and has, so far, denied any links with the 13 companies under the scanner.</p>

<p><strong>The role of the banks</strong><br>

The report adds that the CBI FIR said that banks apparently did not exercise any due diligence in verifying the genuineness of the importers or the documents submitted. "There appears to be no cross-checking regarding the veracity of the bill of entry before permitting the amount to be remitted," it added. For instance, the same bill of entry had been presented to Punjab National Bank by Stelkon on eight occasions, and was reportedly cleared without any verification every single time. Incidentally, this same bill of entry was also submitted to Canara Bank and Corporation Bank. <br>

No wonder Farooq managed to use just 25 bills of entry with a declared value of Rs 3.1 crore with the customs to remit over Rs 680 crore. The rest of the remittance fraud happened using forged documents that inflated the value of the imports.</p>

<p>The daily has previously reported that the CBI's FIR named unknown officials of several banks including Canara Bank, State Bank of Hyderabad, Corporation Bank, Central Bank of India and Axis Bank.</p></p>

	<h1 id="three">ICICI-Videocon: The curious link between Essar co-founder's son-in-law and Deepak Kochhar
	</h1>
	<img src="threel.jpg" id="newsimg" >
	<p id="sp">
		<p>In what could have a bearing on the ongoing ICICI-Videocon-Deepak Kochhar investigations, fresh India links have emerged with Firstland Holdings Limited, the mysterious privately held Mauritius-based investment vehicle that injected the first lot of Rs 325 crore into Deepak Kochhar's NuPower Renewables.</p>

<p>It appears that Firstland also got approval from the then FIPB to invest in Mumbai-based privately held company NSK Holdings, which was incorporated on June 6, 2008. Within 20 days of its incorporation, on June 26, 2008, NSK Holdings received the FIPB approval for investment of $42.84 million (equal to Rs 214.5 crore at prevailing exchange rates) from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings. Firstland Holdings Limited, Mauritius itself was incorporated just six months prior on December 28, 2007. NSK's paid up capital on the date of the FIPB approval was barely Rs 1 lakh although it had an authorised capital of Rs 2 crore. The FIPB approval says Firstland would own 100 per cent foreign equity in NSK Holdings.</p>

<p>NSK Holdings belongs to Mumbai-based Nishant Yogendra Kanodia and Yogendra Surajmal Kanodia who run the Matix group, including IT/business process management firm Datamatics. Nishant Kanodia is the son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia. NSK claims to be in the business of financial intermediation, except insurance and pension funding. However, it appears it is no more than an investment and holding company as its 2016-17 annual report has reported zero revenue.</p>

<p>Kanodias' Matix Group is investing in a 3 million tonne per annum Coal Bed Methane based greenfield ammonia- urea complex at Panagarh, in West Bengal under Matix Fertilisers And Chemicals. The first phase of 1.3 mtpa has been commissioned.</p>

<p>Detailed mails sent to Matix group chairman Yogendra Surajmal Kanodia remained unanswered for nearly a week. Kanodias were asked about the antecedents of Firstland Holdings as well as details of its promoters. Also, regarding the deployment of these funds.</p>

<p>In 2016, investor and whistleblower Arvind Gupta had alleged a quid pro quo in ICICI Bank's Rs 3,250 crore plus Rs 660 crore loans to Venugopal Dhoot-owned Videocon Industries when an identical 10 per cent foreign funding (Rs 325 crore and Rs 66 crore) made its way to ICICI Bank CEO & MD Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar's company NuPower Renewables. Deepak Kochhar and Videocon promoters Dhoots had together set up a 50:50 JV NuPower Renewables in 2008. These revelations led to allegations of propriety and conflict of interest. "Chanda did not know when I set up NuPower. I knew Dhoot through social circles. I told her when Dhoot exited," Deepak told India Today TV.</p>

<p>Besides, the alleged quid pro quo and impropriety in the ICICI-Videocon case, one of the angles being investigated by tax and investigative authorities is whether the investment at all amounts to money laundering and round-tripping.</p>

<p>Any investigation of NuPower Renewables via Firstland Holdings will now have to also account for why and how Firstland got FIPB approvals to invest in Kanodia-owned NSK Holdings and whether there is any link between the two or between Kanodias and the Kochhars.</p>

<p>Yogendra Kanodia is also an alumnus of Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai where Deepak Kochhar graduated. ICICI has an existing relationship with Kanodias. Group firm Datamatics Global Services Limited was awarded the "Best Service Provider" at ICICI Prudential Annual TATVA Awards in April, 2017.</p>

<p>As of March 31, 2017, NSK Holdings had unsecured long term borrowings in the form of bonds and debentures of Rs 150 crore, up 30 crore since the previous fiscal. It also had current assets in the form of short term loans and advances given to the extent of Rs 150 crore, up 50 crore since the previous fiscal. Interestingly, in fiscal 2016-17, the company's cash and cash equivalents fell drastically to barely Rs 87,522 from Rs 20 crore in the previous fiscal. It also reported transactions worth Rs 150 crore under AS 18 which is the accounting standard for disclosure of: Related party relationships; and transactions between a reporting enterprise and its related parties.</p>

<p>Yogendra Kanodia's profile on the Matix Group website claims he's a director in Datamatics group. However, the Datamatics group's board of directors does not feature his name. Datamatics's founder and chairman is Lalit Surajmal Kanodia, who not just founded Datamatics in 1975 but was also involved in setting up of Tata Consultancy Services in 1967. Lalit Kanodia, however, is a board of director in the Matix group. Emails sent to Lalit Kanodia's office also remained unanswered.</p>

<p>He serves as the Chief Mentor at Datamatics. Lalit Kanodia is currently President of IMC chamber of commerce & industry and Indo American Chamber of Commerce (IACC). He's also been an executive member of NASSCOM. He was also the Honorary Consul General of Chile in Mumbai between 2002 and 2014.</p>

<p>Curiously, the two companies with identical names 'Firstland Holdings Limited' were born a decade apart in Hong Kong and Mauritius. They could hold the key to whether Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank CEO & MD Chanda Kochhar, was at all the alleged beneficiary of 10 per cent of that loan, as claimed by investor/whistleblower Arvind Gupta. Deepak Kochhar as well as Videocon Industries have denied any quid pro quo.</p>

<p>However, Firstland Holdings has questionable antecedents. As far back as November 27, 2002, Bank of China (Hong Kong) filed a petition to wind up Firstland Holdings Limited, Hong Kong (company registration no. 0585823). It was set up way back on January 6, 1997. The company was 'Dissolved' on grounds of 'Compulsory Winding Up' by the High Court of Hong Kong on 26 August,2005.</p>

<p>On December 28, 2007, nearly 2 years after the Hong Kong-based Firstland Holdings Limited was wound up, a company by an identical name 'Firstland Holdings Limited' was set up, this time in Mauritius jurisdiction. It was incorporated with registration number C076560 by the Corporate And Business Registration Department of Mauritius.</p>

<p>Firstland Holdings, Mauritius invested funds aggregating Rs 325 crore (10% of the loan amount) into Deepak Kochhar's NuPower Renewables in the form of compulsorily convertible preference shares.</p>

<p>Who owned Firstland Holdings, Hong Kong and why it went into bankruptcy may hold answers to why Firstland Mauritius came into being.</p>

<p>It isn't clear whether the identical names of the two companies is mere co-incidence or both belong to the same owners/promoters. Since both these companies were registered as 'private' at Hong Kong and Mauritius Registrars, their ownership is not publicly available.</p>

<p>Corporate ownership and identity is often shrouded in layers of holding structures across multiple geographies to camouflage real ownership of funds or tax avoidance. Routing ownership or investment via multiple geographies makes it answerable to various jurisdictions and equally complex and lengthy legal procedures. This makes it much more difficult to peel open the corporate veil.</p>

<p>Starting and shutting businesses in various countries is a standard tactic to create investigating dead-ends. Investigating agencies have a difficult task lifting this corporate veil. </p></p>

	<h1 id="four">Wipro numbers disappoint and guidance muted, say analysts
	</h1>
	<img src="fourl.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>The much awaited financial numbers from the third largest Indian IT giant, Wipro, have fallen short of analyst and market expectations, be it in terms of revenue growth or the margins. Analysts believe that there are hardly any positive takeaways from the numbers, apart from glimpses of some good performance in select verticals and geographies.

Sudheer Guntupalli, analyst at Ambit Capital, who was expecting the company to post better numbers feels it was a disappointment across the board. This, he says, is despite the CEO guiding that the company will exit FY18 with growth rate matching industry rate.

Then, the company had some one-offs in terms of impairments. In the results, the company points out, "For the year, we recognized provisions totalling Rs 5,255 million ($81 million) with respect to insolvency of two customers and impairment loss of one of our acquisitions. For the quarter, we recognized provisions totalling Rs 2,080 million ($32 million) with respect to insolvency of a customer and the impairment loss in one of our acquisitions."

Analysts are also unhappy with the IT services margin of 15.8 per cent, adjusted for the impact of insolvency of two customers and the impairment loss in case of one acquisition. Excluding these factors, the IT services margin that the company reported for the year were at 16.8 per cent.

The analysts also seem to find the guidance for the next quarter muted and this seems to have added to the overall disappointment.

However, it adds, "We had announced the divestiture of our hosted data centre services business to Ensono for a consideration of $ 405 million. We expect the transaction to complete during the quarter ending June 3, 2018. For the purpose of the Outlook , we have not considered the impact of the divestment on the revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2018. We will revise the Outlook for the quarter based on the actual date of completion of the divestment."

Madhu Babu, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, too, hoped to see more organic growth happening in the company. He is finds the numbers overall disappointing.

However, the good news for the company has been the good performance of select verticals like the BFSI, and in select geographies like Europe, where sequential growth was shown.  There is also some comfort in terms of valuation, says Sandip Agarwal from Edelweiss, though he feels the numbers are a bit disappointing.

	<h1 id="1">ICICI-Videocon loan: I-T Dept seeks details of personal transactions, finances from Deepak Kochhar
	</h1>
	<img src="t1.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>As the Income Tax Department moves ahead in its investigation with regard to conflict of interest allegations in the ICICI-Videocon loan case, a fresh notice has been sent to NuPower co-founder and CEO Deepak Kochhar. The department has asked him to furnish the details of his personal transactions and other finances in the next 10 days.  

Before this, the taxman had sent two notices to Kochhar, who is also the husband of ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, seeking financial details about his role as the Managing Director of NuPower Renewables, an independent power producer in the renewable energy sector. The department had also sought the share valuation report for investment in NuPower, balance sheets, and profit details from Kochhar, who founded NuPower along with Videocon Chairman Venugopal Dhoot way back in 2008.

Deepak Kochhar-led NuPower Renewables Private Ltd is in the eye of the storm due to the 'quid pro quo' allegations in the ICICI Bank's Rs 3,250-crore plus Rs 660 crore loans to Venugopal Dhoot-owned Videocon Industries in 2012. It has been alleged that during the time these two loans were given to Videocon, Deepak Kochhar's NuPower received an identical 10 per cent foreign funding (Rs 325 crore and Rs 66 crore) from two Mauritius-based firms, First Land Holding Limited and DH Renewables Holding Limited.

The taxman is now studying the nature of activities of NuPower Renewables between 2010-11 and 2015-16. The earlier notices were issued to Deepak Kochhar under Section 131 (power regarding discovery, production of evidence) of the I-T Act. The department has also sought the names and addresses, the nationality of the promoters, directors, and beneficial shareholders of these firms as part of the earlier two notices, the officials had said.

The department had also sent a detailed questionnaire, seeking details of the firms' operations, to be answered by Deepak Kochhar as it is probing the investments made by the two Mauritius-based firms in his company with suspected links to the Videocon-ICICI Bank loan case. The CBI is already conducting a preliminary enquiry in this loan case and has named Kochhar in it.

	<h1 id="2">Stainless steel leads the wave of value addition in the steel industry
	</h1>
	<img src="t2.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>It was a year for steel. In 2017, India crossed the 100 million tonne (MT) mark in crude steel production. As for stainless steel, the country secured the second largest producer tag, next only to China. Stainless steel production in the country touched 3.6 MT during the year, registering an annual growth rate of 10 per cent.

The consumption of stainless steel in a country is organically linked to its economic development. Going by India's GDP growth rate, and the fact that our per capita consumption of stainless steel is 2 kg as against the world average of 6 kg, it is evident that stainless steel has ample scope for growth. In the age of constant value addition coupled with environment consciousness, stainless steel is the most practical and optimal choice among all materials.

Stainless Steel: The value maximizer

Throughout history, humans have been hungry for improvement. From cars to homes to public utilities, we want everything to be aesthetic and efficient. This ever-rising public aspiration in all spheres of life is the inflection point that the stainless steel industry has been looking forward to. Because stainless steel is a metal that can cater to varied present and future needs.

Unlike other alternatives including carbon steel, cement, plastics, glass, and aluminium composites, stainless steel is non-corrosive and self-repairing by its inherent nature. This validates why there has been a major transformation in the end use profile of stainless steel over the last few decades:

Automotive, Railway & Transport (ART) sector: The high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to impact and temperature shocks makes stainless steel the most fuel efficient and safe option in the ART sector. While developed nations deploy 19 per cent stainless steel in motor vehicles, developing countries consume it to the tune of 5 per cent. This number is set to increase with the Euro VI norms kicking in by 2020, which can't be implemented without stainless steel exhausts. The Indian Railways, which plans to convert 55,000 normal train coaches to the significantly safer LHB technology, can't do so without using stainless steel coaches.  

The Indian ART sector is adding value at each stage, and stainless steel is steadily gaining momentum. Jindal Stainless is already supplying material for bus bodies and fuel tanks. We're fast replacing plastics in this segment. Where plastic fuel tanks withstand temperatures up to 100 degree centigrade, those made of stainless steel can withstand up to 1000 degree centigrade. Besides, plastics are environmentally hazardous.

Architecture, Building & Construction (ABC) sector: Stainless steel ups the value game in this sector by its proven track record in longevity, non-corrosion and hygiene. The National Steel Policy 2017, therefore, emphasises use of stainless steel in public health and seismic and coastal zones.

Successful experiments in cities like Tokyo and Taipei demonstrate how distribution losses of water can reduce from around 40 per cent to 2 per cent, if we replace cement and carbon steel pipelines with stainless steel pipelines. Stainless steel plays a pivotal role in the national imperative of swachh bharat and river rejuvenation. Creating long-lasting and sturdy infrastructure for water conservation, including sewage, waste and effluent treatment plants, necessarily requires high grade stainless steel.

Growing annually at 13 per cent, the ABC sector is teeming with opportunities. Residential and commercial real estate projects, retail spaces, entertainment avenues, hospitality, healthcare and urban infrastructure are extensively using stainless steel. There's no doubting that the foundations of smart cities will be laid in stainless steel products. The special finishes available in stainless steel, one of the latest value-adds gaining market traction in the form of coloured sheets and anti-skid floors, combine utilitarian benefits with pure aesthetic delight.

Process Industries: Maintenance free long life and flawless hygiene characteristics of stainless steel make it an ideal choice for process industries. Food processing, for instance, relies heavily on stainless steel. More and more industries, such as refineries, petrochemical, power, textile, cement, drugs, paper are switching to stainless for these reasons.

Stainless steel is increasingly being consumed to produce clean energy. Desalination, which will pave the way through future water crises, is based on stainless steel. Flue-gas desulfurization, or FGD, a process that removes sulfur dioxide from exhausts, is also impossible without stainless steel. The metal is also gaining ground in nuclear power. Jindal Stainless is one of the two stainless steel suppliers in the world selected to supply 1,100 tons of stainless steel to the prestigious International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor's Cryostat Project in France.

The possibility of endless diversification

The high impact toughness, crash worthiness, superior weldability, formability, free maintenance, and higher elongation of stainless steel makes it a favourite choice for end users as well as manufacturers. Medical advancement, including surgical instruments, artificial stents, and knee and joint implants, draws heavily from the benefits of stainless steel. Recently, Jindal Stainless developed a special grade of high-nitrogen stainless steel for the defence sector in collaboration with Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory.

Given its ability to offer immense scope for diversification, stainless steel is poised to be the metal of the future.

	<h1 id="4">7th Pay Commission: Increased HRA pushed up CPI inflation, says research paper
	</h1>
	<img src="t4.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>Increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for the central government employees under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) had raised concerns that this might lead to more inflation. Now, a research paper by RBI's monetary policy department has confirmed that revised HRA has impacted CPI inflation by nearly 35 basis points at its peak.

"Ex-post analysis of CPI shows that the 7th CPC's HRA increase pushed up headline inflation prints gradually from July 2017, with a peak impact of about 35 bps," the research paper titled 'Impact of Increase in House Rent Allowance on CPI Inflation' said.

The increase in HRA under the 7th pay commission was put into effect from July 2017. As per the recommendations of the pay panel, the basic pay of central government employees was increased by a factor of 2.57. This led to HRA being revised by 105.6 per cent that is more than double the pre-CPC level. This pushed up housing inflation significantly, which in turn, increased the headline inflation. The impact has been observed in most of the states and union territories.

Housing forms a major part of CPI with a weight of 10.07 per cent. Out of this, house rent weighs 9.51 per cent and that of other miscellaneous housing services 0.56 per cent. Central Statistics Office (CSO) considers both rented and self-owned houses in urban centres for compiling housing index.

Some state governments had also increased the pay and allowances for their employees on the lines of 7th pay commission but its impact is not showing up in the data due to several reasons, the paper said.

"First, there may be administrative delays between announcement and actual disbursals. Second, the disbursals may be partial/ staggered at States' discretion. Third, even if disbursements have been made, the representation of State government houses in the sample of dwellings may not be adequate to capture the impact," the research paper said.

As states' impact unfolds going forward, for the existing series, housing index may be published separately for the government dwellings and other dwellings, the paper said.

The paper suggested that since proper assessment and understanding of HRA impact is important for policy analysis, the producers of CPI may consider - for the future base revisions, while preparing fixed sample of dwellings for each state for collecting house rent data, representative share of government houses that reflect the actual share of central and state government houses in the states may be kept.

	<h1 id="5">Centre planning nationwide 'Kisan Kalyan Karyashala' for farmer outreach on May 2
	</h1>
	<img src="t5.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>In a massive, countrywide farmer outreach exercise, the central government will organize block level Kisan Kalyan Karyashala on May 2, where farmers from each block will gather to interact with agriculture officers, scientists and progressive farmers to discuss ways to increase their income through adoption of new technology. The occasion will also provide an opportunity to create awareness of various central government programmes.

Informing this at the National Kharif Conference 2018 organised in New Delhi, Minister of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Radha Mohan Singh sought the full cooperation of state governments to implement the central schemes and missions in respective states.

"All-round development of the agriculture sector is needed to ensure the stock of food and agriculture product; and enhance farmers' income. The aim of the government is to make agriculture policy and programs 'income-oriented' rather than 'production-oriented," the minister said.

The minister said that the government is committed to agrarian reforms and will provide adequate budgetary support to all the programmes.

The 'multi-dimensional seven-point' strategy pursued by the ministry includes an emphasis on irrigation along with end to end solution on creation of resources for 'more crop per drop', provision of quality seeds and nutrients according to the soil quality of each farm, large investments in warehouses and cold chains to prevent post-harvest losses and promotion of value addition through food processing. The minister also highlighted the need for implementation of National Agricultural Markets and e-platforms (e-NAM) to eliminate shortcomings of all the 585 centers and introduction of crop insurance scheme at a lower cost. Promotion of allied activities such as dairy-animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping, Har Medh Per Ped, horticulture, and fisheries was also highlighted.

"The main goal of the government is not only to identify potential areas of agriculture where more investment needs to be made but also to enhance income by diversification into horticulture and animal husbandry and fisheries and suggest ways to reduce risks. In order to achieve the goal of doubling farmers' income, the agriculture ministry has been continuously working to reduce the cost of farming; increase production through better productivity; ensuring profitable returns and risk management given the uncertainty of weather," he pointed out.

The minister stressed the role of schemes such as National Food Security Mission, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm, Rashtriya Gokul Mission, National Livestock Mission, Blue Revolution etc. in boosting productivity. Similarly, to reduce the cost of farming, Soil Health Card, use of neem-coated urea and more crop per drop etc are being implemented successfully, he claimed. While  e-NAM, cold storage, storage facility at concessional rate of interest, post-harvest credit facility, increase in base MSP etc were projected as means of improving income, adoption of risk management and sustainable practices, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and organic farming mission for north east were highlighted as the other schemes that will help fulfill the seven point strategy.

	<h1 id="6">Cash-strapped Naidu's push for tech-enabled governance projects in Andhra
	</h1>
	<img src="t6.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>Nara Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, is often called a cyber savvy politician and with good reason. Back in late 90s, when Madhapur was little more than a rocky suburb of Hyderabad, Naidu, as the chief minister of the then united Andhra Pradesh, transformed it into an IT hub. The suburb eventually got rechristened as Cyberabad.

Today, Naidu, short of funds to build a new capital at Amaravati, near Vijayawada in Andhra, is showcasing Andhra's tech governance projects, including a major real-time governance control centre that he has set up in Amaravati. Permanent building structures have been built across 6 lakh sq ft at Rs 600 crore in the new capital, to temporarily house the state secretariat.

One such tech project is the state government's collaboration with IT major Tech Mahindra to establish, what is being billed, as the country's first Cyber Security Operations Centre (APCSOC). The state-of-the-art Cyber Security Operations Centre, launched on Monday, April 23rd, in the new capital region and currently in Vijayawada, is equipped with traditional security operations centre and predictive threat analytics capabilities.

The security coverage extends to all the central and state government entities, according to a media release put out by Tech Mahindra. It quotes Rajiv Singh, Global Head of Enterprise Security & Risk Management, Tech Mahindra, as saying: "In order to protect government infrastructure and assets from the threats of growing and constantly evolving cyber-attacks, we have designed and deployed the Andhra Pradesh Cyber Security Operations Centre, (APCSOC) - that will extend its security coverage to all state government departments and entities. This is a big step forward towards an integrated approach to security and risk management - an aspect that is affecting both the private and government sectors today."

While the investment numbers are not readily available, it should be noted that Naidu is not in the best of times financially. He is miffed with the centre and after the split with the former partner BJP, is already coping with rising debt, growing revenue deficit and pending bills.

But then, a visit to state secretariat, particularly, Naidu's office block will tell you the importance he gives to the use of information technology. A key symbol of this is his real-time governance facility - a large glass-panelled room with huge wall size screens and parallel desktop monitors, giving real-time information on various parameters about government department files that have been digitised and can be accessed by ministers and officials anytime, anywhere. Then, there is CM Office Real Time Executive, called CORE dashboard in quickspeak, which is meant to provide details of the power situation, weather updates and forecasts, water levels in canals and the progress of government schemes.

Balaji Adivishnu, director in the department of real time governance in the chief minister's office says that since September last year, what stands out is the scale at which satisfaction levels of citizens across 34 different schemes are getting measured. Apart from this, for nearly three years now, there has been extensive use of IoT using more than one million sensors. In addition, at regular intervals, Balaji Adivishnu says, Naidu monitors the progress of the construction in the capital region based on the drone shot images and regular video conferences.

	<h1 id="7">OnePlus 6 Avengers Infinity War Limited Edition coming to India on May 17
	</h1>
	<img src="t7.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>OnePlus finally gave us the launch date for the OnePlus 6 but the feast for brand's fans doesn't end there. The company has revealed a trailer of the new special edition OnePlus 6 that will be themed on the Avengers Infinity War.

OnePlus announced this partnership to celebrate 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The trailer gives us a good look at the front panel of the device but what's interesting is the back panel of the device. The panel seems to be textures with squared off stripes.

The company will be launching this special edition phone along with the standard version which has long been elusive to the public eye. With the launch date closing up, OnePlus is revealing more and more of their flagship device.

This new teaser is all about the Avengers Special Edition which OnePlus had declared last month. The company also announced a giveaway of 6000 tickets to the movie which went live on 10 am, April 26.

 It will be interesting to see how OnePlus will incorporate the textured back with either the glass or ceramic material. Most leaks have confirmed that the company will finally be introducing wireless charging with the OnePlus 6.

There's a host of features that have been leaked by OnePlus and then there are numerous unofficial leaks that almost reveal the entire design of the device. Here's what we know about the rest of the specifications.

The OnePlus 6 will feature a Snapdragon 845 chipset along with three variants. One with 64GB storage and 6GB RAM, the second with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM and the third with 256GB storage and 8GB RAM.

The prices of the OnePlus is also expected to get a substantial jump. The cheapest variant is expected to cost the buyer around Rs 34,000 and the highest variant is expected to be priced above Rs 45,000.

The premium price is expected to get premium features like a near bezel-less display with a notch on the top. The new teaser of the Avengers Special Edition phone goes on to confirm the notch design. OnePlus claims it has incorporated a way to disable the notch using the software.

The premium-list doesn't end there. The device will also feature a glass or ceramic back which goes on to indicate that the OnePlus 6 will have wireless charging.

This time around the Chinese company has decided to go with a vertical camera setup this time, instead of the horizontal one seen on the back of OnePlus 5T.

The dual snappers have been placed in the centre with the LED flash and the fingerprint scanner placed underneath them. The shape of the fingerprint reader has been changed too.

	<h1 id="8">Gmail takes inspiration from Instagram, Snapchat; welcome disappearing e-mails
	</h1>
	<img src="t8.jpg"  id="newsimg">
	<p>Gmail, a mail service that most of us use daily but one that has been looking the same since almost five years. Google has finally updated the Gmail for more functionality and slightly better visual appeal. The company has made it official that its e-mail application has undergone a major transformation. The redesigned Gmail for web consists of a snooze button as well as confidential mode, features like smart replies and many more. The new Gmail for the web resembles the Gmail mobile app.

It seems Google has taken cues from popular social media applications like Instagram and Snapchat to introduce dissapearing messages. Gmail now allows the sender to set a deadline for the mail which means that the receiver would not be able to see the mail after a couple of days or weeks.

Another update is the inclusion of a confidential mode. In this new update, the confidential mode allows the sender to remove the option of downloading, copying, printing of e-mails and messages for the receiver. The sender can choose this option if the mail is classified or sensitive in nature.

Gmail's lead product manager Jacob Bank said that the new version of Gmail will allow the users to have access to attachments right from the inbox without opening the mail. The new snooze button feature allows you to put off the e-mails that you don't want to read at that point of time. In case you forget to reply to the mail, the new Gmail will nudge you with reminders related to that unanswered mail.

The Smart Reply feature which was once available only on the Gmail mobile app will now be available on the web version too. Apart from these new features, Google is also bringing certain features for the mobile application such as notifications of high priority that will remind you of important e-mails. Gmail will also give you suggestions related to unsubscribing irrelevant offers and newsletters.

Jacob Bank further added, "The redesign was done with an eye on making people more productive and safe." These new features in Gmail are some of the massive transformations for the users both on web and mobile. The new update will start rolling out to most users in the coming weeks.
